    <h1>About</h1>
    What is this? The Rick and Morty API is a REST(ish) and GraphQL API based on
    the television show Rick and Morty. You will have access to about hundreds
    of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is
    filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show. Check out the
    documentation to get started

    <h1>Who are you?</h1>
    We are Axel Fuhrmann, a guy who likes to develop things and Talita, the
    "Rick and Morty data scientist" and hardcore fan.

    <h1>Why did you build this?</h1>
    Because we were really interested in the idea of writing an open source
    project and also because Rick and Morty is our favorite show at that moment,
    so why not?

    <h1>Technical stuff?</h1>
    The entire project is hosted on Digital Ocean and Netlify. GraphQL cache is
    handled through Stellate. We use Node and MongoDB to serve the API.

    <h1>How can I contribute to the project?</h1>
    You can help us to keep the project alive and you can also contribute on
    GitHub.

    <h1>Copyright?</h1>
    Rick and Morty is created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Adult Swim.
    The data and images are used without claim of ownership and belong to their
    respective owners. This API is open source and uses a BSD license.
